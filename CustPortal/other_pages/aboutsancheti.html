			<p>Sancheti Institute for Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation (SIOR), located in Pune, was established in 1972 by Padma Vibhushan Dr. K.H. Sancheti, a pioneer in the field of Orthopaedics. Today SIOR is a one of Asiaâ€™s largest orthopaedic & rehabilitation hospitals with patients from across the world. SIOR is an ISO recognized state-of-the-art healthcare organization, delivering integrated healthcare services and is also a post graduate teaching institute. Sancheti has been imparting education for the past 30 years, and was one of the first to achieve this status apart from Government hospitals. Today it stands as one of the most important centres for quality orthopaedic care, education and research.</p>
			<p>At SIOR, all efforts are made and no stone is left unturned to make the patient happy. A commitment to ethical medical practice plays a key role in ensuring the patient receives the best available treatment at an affordable cost.</p>
			<p>SIOR has been enriching lives, not only through treatment in the hospital, but through various Social Activities as well. A number of free <strong>socio-medical camps and other social initiatives</strong> are also organized on a regular basis to benefit the poor and needy.</p>
