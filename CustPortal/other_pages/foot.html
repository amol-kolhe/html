				<div class="workwithus-text">
					<p>Foot pain and injury is extremely common. Foot pain can be sourced from local structures such as muscles, ligaments, bones and joint or it can be referred from other sources including your lower back and other systemic diseases.</p>
					<p>Common sources of foot pain include plantar fasciitis, bunion, heel pain, heel spur and ankle injuries.</p>
					<p>Because foot pain can have so many causes it is very important to have foot pain assessed by a health professional with an expertise in the management of foot pain. Only then can you be confident that your foot pain treatment is managing the "right" cause of your foot pain.
