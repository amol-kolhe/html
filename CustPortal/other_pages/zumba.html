                <div class="workwithus-text">
                    <p>Based on the beats of salsa, reggaetón and Bollywood, some may take Zumba to be more of a social dance event than a strict-and-traditional workout that one often finds tagged to Aerobics and cardio.</p>
                    <p>But Zumba is much more than a fad or a trend or just some ‘silly dance moves’. And for all you haters of exercise and routines-it is Christmas come early!</p>
                    <p>Let us breakdown to you why Zumba has gained so much popularity over the past few years. Born completely by accident by a fitness instructor, Alberto “Beto” Perez from Colombia, this sensation took over fitness clubs for not only its element of ‘fun’-but also its medical advantages. This choreographed workout-routine helps with weight-loss, prevents heart diseases, improves flexibility and cognitive skills, relieves stress and promotes psychological welfare-to name some! And unlike gym workouts tied to timed sequences-which may make some of us even dread “exercise”-Zumba is a great way to break the dullness and repetitiveness of a routine and have some fun breaking dance moves. It keeps you engaged much longer than the usual ‘gym-commitment’-and you will find yourself putting on your shoes and jumping into the fray more willingly than you would have believed. Apart from an interesting and intense workout that will increase your oxygen intake and help build a decent sweat and burn calories-facilitated by an instructor who will be dancing along to keep things instructive and lively-you will learn some great Latin American and Bollywood moves to show off with!</p>
                    <p><b>For beginners, here is what we have instore:</b></p>
                    <p>We, at Healyos, are providing for classes by our expert physiotherapists who also happen to be certified for Zumba-routines at our clinic in Aundh, Pune. So, make avail of these clinical sessions and get the advantage of a fit and enduring body!</p>

            <div class="workwithus-section1-content"> 
                <div class="workwithus-heading"><h2><b>Pilates</b></h2></div>
                <div class="workwithus-text">
                    <p>Some may say that Yoga and Pilates are almost the same. But there is a subtle difference-flexibility and core-strength. And each has its own prioritized target to achieve. Can you guess which one is for which? </p>
                    <p>Let’s start with Pilates, a series of planned and precise exercises done in sets, focused on-you got that right-strengthening your core muscles-such as your spine! </p>
                    <p>Spinal health is itself a trend-setter of a modern-day healthy lifestyle. A good spinal posture affects your form, the way you sit, the way you walk-and sometimes even how tall you look! But those are just the outwardly instances. Most of us have at some point of time, experienced spinal-pain due to a weak spinal-core. This is especially more apparent in desk jobs-say an IT firm-where you find yourself sitting for the entire duration of the time. People, in the age-group of early 20s to 30s are experiencing these lifestyle disorders as well. If you want proof, just check out the queues in front of the Physiotherapy department of any hospital. </p>
                    <p>In today’s day, one needs to be aware of these lifestyle-peeves that could hamper your life and prevent you from giving your best in all situations-and know how to defend yourself against them!</p> 
                    <p>Pilates, when learnt under the instructions of an able teacher and preferably an expert physiotherapist, might be a start on the way of enlightenment and empowerment of your own body. Pilates is not only good for your spine, but also strengthens your leg muscles, abdomen and pelvis and certainly adds up to that fine posture and fit body. And the best part about it is-it isn’t as difficult and complicated as one might associate with other forms of workouts!</p>

                    <p>But if you are a beginner, here are some things to be kept on mind:</p>
                    <p><b>Know your reasons:</b> It is always wise to know what you are getting into. Ask our Physiotherapists at Healyos, if you need more clarification and understanding on the subject. We are more than happy to provide for information. </p>
                    <p>So, check-in to our Pilates classes in Aundh, at our very own clinic partnered with Sancheti.</p>
                    <p>Now, get out your yoga mat and get cracking!</p>
