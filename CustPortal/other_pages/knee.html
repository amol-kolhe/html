				<div class="workwithus-text">
					<p>There are many types of knee injuries and conditions, which can be treated successfully by Physiotherapy. These range from ligament and cartilage problems to tendon and muscular strains. Knee pain can also be due to overuse injuries, sudden injuries or conditions such as arthritis, gout or infections. Our Physiotherapists are experts in assessing the cause of knee pain and treating the problem effectively.</p>
<p>It is important that the correct diagnosis is made for all knee injuries and that treatment commences as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Treatment techniques can include specific strengthening exercises to correct a muscle imbalance, soft tissue massage, joint mobilisation, and the fitting of custom made orthotics (biomechanics) to correct excessive foot pronation. This has a direct link to patellofemoral pain and a full biomechanical assessment can be performed by our skilled Physiotherapists to determine the imbalance in your foot.
