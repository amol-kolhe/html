				<div class="workwithus-text">
					<p>Frozen shoulder and rotator cuff problems are commonly faced problems; whereas things like acromioclavicular joint trouble and shoulder instability tend to affect younger people, especially those who play contact sports or sport involving repetitive shoulder movements.</p>
<p>It can become a chronic problem if you don’t treat it, with up to 50% of people still having symptoms after 18 months.</p>
<p>Shoulder rehabilitation focuses on two aspects of shoulder motion: flexibility and strength. Without adequate range of motion, you’ll be very limited in what you can do; so the goal is to be able to function normally without pain.</p>
<p>It’s also important to strengthen the muscles around the shoulder and not to stress the rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. These muscles are susceptible to injury and inflammation if the exercises aren’t being done correctly, so your physiotherapist will guide you through the correct form.</p>
<p>Chronic shoulder pain is often a result of repetitive overhead activities, like tennis; certain swimming strokes, etc. and such pain is a result of damage to the rotator cuff muscles.
