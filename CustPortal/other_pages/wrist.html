					<p>Wrist pain or injury is common and can usually be successfully diagnosed and treated by your physiotherapist. Wrist pain can occur as a result of sports injuries, work injuries or simply everyday arm use.</p>
					<p>An accurate diagnosis is vital to the correct management of your wrist pain. Wrist pain can be caused by local muscle, tendon or joint injury. Alternatively, wrist pain can be referred from your neck joints or a trapped nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the best known nerve entrapment of the wrist.</p>
					<p>Wrist pain and injury respond favourably to physiotherapy intervention when early treatment is sought. Please do not delay in consulting your physiotherapist if you experience wrist pain. Some wrist conditions do require surgery, so early assessment and intervention is important.
