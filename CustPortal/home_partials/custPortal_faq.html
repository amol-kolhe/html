				<div class="accordion_body" style="display: none;"> 
					<p>You don't require a referral to see a Physiotherapist. HealYos Physiotherapists undergo intensive training, as per current international best practice, so that we have the necessary skills to examine, diagnose, treat and advise our patients with no previous input, or referral from a doctor.</p>
					<p>If, upon examination, your condition needs the intervention of another medical practioner, we will inform you accordingly.</p>
					<p>In case, your doctor has recommended Physiotherapy to you, we can work closely with your doctor, to optimise your care.</p>
