					<p>Sometimes simple home interventions are not enough to treat cervical disc disease, in which an abnormality in one or more discs that lie between the vertebrae cause neck pain. Often, though, it helps to see a physical therapist that can treat abnormalities, show you how to stretch and strengthen your neck and vertebrae, improve your posture, and prevent neck pain from recurring. In the majority of people, certain exercises and manipulations used by the physical therapist can help relieve discomfort and restore movements.</p>
					<p>When you visit a physical therapist youâ€™ll first have a complete evaluation relevant to your symptoms such as pain in the neck or between the shoulder blades, pain that radiates down the arm to the hand or fingers, or numbness or tingling in the shoulder or arm. Your strength, reflexes, and other potential sources of pain will be checked. The therapist will also assess joint function in your neck and upper back and lower back to identify limitations or dysfunctions that may contribute to your pain.</p>
