					<div class="accordion1_body" style="display: none;"> 
						<p>You don't require a referral to see a Physiotherapist. HealYos Physiotherapists undergo intensive training, as per current international best practice, so that we have the necessary skills to examine, diagnose, treat and advise our patients with no previous input, or referral from a doctor.</p>
						<p>If, upon examination, your condition needs the intervention of another medical practioner, we will inform you accordingly.</p>
						<p>In case, your doctor has recommended Physiotherapy to you, we can work closely with your doctor, to optimise your care.</p>

						<span class="accordian1-title">What is Physiotherapy? Who are Physiotherapists?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion1_body" style="display: none;"> 
						<p>Physiotherapy is a <strong>medical discipline</strong>. In India, Physiotherapists take the common entrance tests just like specialists in other medical fields, and then undergo <u><strong>4.5 years of education to get their Bachelors degree</strong></u>, the BPT (Bachelor’s in Physiotherapy). A Masters in Physiotherapy ( MPT) degree can last between 1-3 years. <i>Physiotherapists are experts in human movement and function, with deep understanding of the structure and working of the human body</i>. They use a variety of techniques e.g. Manual Therapy, Exercise Therapy, Dry Needling etc, to assist their patients. They work collaboratively with patients, to free them of pain, and to conquer specific problems, with physical motion, that hinder normal daily activity and reduce overall quality of life. (Adapted from definitions by the Australian Physiotherapy Association and the World Confederation for Physical Therapy).</p>

						<span class="accordian1-title">How is Physiotherapy different from massage?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion1_body" style="display: none;"> 
						<p>Physiotherapy is not massage. A massage training course lasts between a few weeks to six months. A BPT Physiotherapist trains for 4.5 years. A Masters in Physiotherapy trains for 6-7 years to receive their university recognised degrees. Physiotherapy is a medical requirement for rectifying underlying problems whereas Massage is primarily used for relaxation and rejuvenation. Physiotherapists use a variety of techniques to diagnose, assess and treat their patients. They address these concerns primarily through corrective exercises. In addition they may use electrotherapeutic modalities e.g. Ultrasound, Interferential Therapy (IFT). Several Physiotherapists also, undergo specialist training such as Mulligans Manual Therapy, Maitland Manual Therapy, Taping, etc.</p>

						<span class="accordian1-title">What can I expect in my HealYos Physiotherapy sessions?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion1_body" style="display: none;"> 
						<p>Your first session with Healyos is an assessment session, where your Physiotherapist understands your history, diagnoses your condition, and sets up a treatment plan that aligns with the outcomes you seek from your treatment.</p>
						<p>Your treatment begins from your second session, where your Physiotherapist uses a range of specialist techniques, continually making adjustments to the treatment plan based on your response. <i>You can also expect some homework from your Physiotherapist, such as some body movements, exercises and lifestyle modifications, that not only enhance and maintain the effect of the treatment, they prevent recurrence of the original problem.</i></p>
