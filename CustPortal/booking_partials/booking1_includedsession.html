			<p>In your first session, our physio expert will understand your history, assess and diagnose your condition and develop a treatment plan that aligns with your treatment goals.</p>
			<p>Your treatment begins from your second session, where our physiotherapist works with you by prescribing and monitoring excercises for specific muscle groups, as per your treatment plan. You should also expect 'homework' : exercises and lifestyle modifications to prevent recurrence of the original problem.</p>
